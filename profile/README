ðŸ”­ GitHub Projects

You will find that most projects are _private_ (only Team-members can view [and edit] these), 
some repositories are _public_. We aim to publish each repository associated to a publication 
from the team. Data associated to our analyses can be found on community-standard data-
storage and -archiving repositories including _EGA_ and _Zenodo_ (just follow the link 
in the paper), or through [DataverseNL](https://dataverse.nl/dataverse/UMCU).
