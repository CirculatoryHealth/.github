### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ You've reached the **Circulatory Health Team GitHub**. We are **(medical) biologists**, 
**medical doctors**, **geneticists**, **bioinformaticians**, and **data scientists** 
interested in solving **medical problems** with a burning :fire: passion ðŸ’—: for **cardiovascular diseases :anatomical_heart:**. 


ðŸ‘¯ We are always happy to _collaborate_ on any subject in the field cardiovascular diseases.


ðŸ”­ GitHub Projects

You will find that most projects are _private_ (only Team-members can view [and edit] these), 
some repositories are _public_. We aim to publish each repository associated to a publication 
from the team. Data associated to our analyses can be found on community-standard data-
storage and -archiving repositories including _EGA_ and _Zenodo_ (just follow the link 
in the paper), or through [DataverseNL](https://dataverse.nl/dataverse/UMCU).
